# React.js Bootcamp - Class Notes (Day 1)

## Introduction to React.js

Welcome to the first day of our React.js bootcamp! In today's session, we delved into the fundamentals of React.js, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Here's a recap of what we covered:

### What is React.js?

- React.js is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces.
- It allows us to create reusable UI components that manage their own state.
- React.js follows a component-based architecture, making it easier to develop complex UIs by breaking them down into smaller, reusable parts.

## Components

In React.js, everything is a component. Components are the building blocks of React applications, and they encapsulate the UI logic and behavior.

### Types of Components

- **Functional Components:** These are JavaScript functions that take props as input and return React elements.
- **Class Components:** These are ES6 classes that extend the React.Component class and have additional features like lifecycle methods and state.

## States

State is a built-in feature in React components that allows components to manage their own data. It represents the mutable data that can change over time, affecting the rendering of the component.

### setState()

- The `setState()` method is used to update the state of a component.
- It merges the new state object with the previous state object.
- It triggers the re-rendering of the component with the updated state.

## Next Steps

Now that we have a foundational understanding of React.js, it's time to start building! In our next session, we'll dive deeper into component composition, props, and more advanced state management techniques.

Stay tuned for more exciting React.js concepts and hands-on coding exercises in our upcoming classes!
